It's XCOM 2.5. I don't dislike the XCOM games so I'm not too mad, but considering who's making it I'm still disappointed about how it's literally just a straight-up copy of XCOM with a different visual theme and some neat new gimmicks tacked on, rather than something that takes the original X-Com games into the modern era. I'll still play the game and probably enjoy it as well, but I can't feel like it's a massive missed opportunity.
>Hopes/Dreams for XCOM 3
- Abandon the overly simplified 2-action gameplay model and either bring back time units or something new entirely. 
- Get rid of pods/pod activation and make it so aliens are individually placed on the map and react logically to spotting an enemy. As in, don't just activate a pod whenever you're spotted, activate the one alien that spotted you and give it the ability to call for help or something to bring his friends into the fight. 
- Give stealth/noise a bigger role. So even if you blow up an entire pod (or just a group of enemies if they're no longer using pods), the noise generated will alert everyone nearby and possibly get you overrun. This is similar to what they had with the zombies in WotC except give all aliens the ability to detect loud noises not just zombies.
- Silent Storm levels of terrain destruction.

Yes, anything with tits is worth a consideration to fuck.

Jesus, this. I get that you are an underground organization fighting against the odds but its fucking infuriating working the Geoscape in 2 when it constantly interrupts you - It's a videogame equivalent of trying to hold a public speech and you have a co-speaker with Tourettes next to you

Fuck yeah it is, the new shit they add is great. Seems to go on sale pretty often so I'd say you could afford waiting for one of those. I paid full price for both Vanilla and WOTC and didn't regret it.

>      MECs. They're just an amazing addition to the gameplay that was sorely lacking in XCOM2. Sparks just cant compete, especially since you dont cut up people for a spark.
