I don't dislike the XCOM games so I'm not too mad, but considering who's making it I'm still disappointed about how it's literally just a straight-up copy of XCOM with a different visual theme and some neat new gimmicks tacked on, rather than something that takes the original X-Com games into the modern era. I'll still play the game and probably enjoy it as well, but I can't feel like it's a massive missed opportunity.\n>Hopes/Dreams for XCOM 3\n- Abandon the overly simplified 2-action gameplay model and either bring back time units or something new entirely. \n- Get rid of pods/pod activation and make it so aliens are individually placed on the map and react logically to spotting an enemy. As in, don't just activate a pod whenever you're spotted, activate the one alien that spotted you and give it the ability to call for help or something to bring his friends into the fight. \n- Give stealth/noise a bigger role. So even if you blow up an entire pod (or just a group of enemies if they're no longer using pods), the noise generated will alert everyone nearby and possibly get you overrun. This is similar to what they had with the zombies in WotC except give all aliens the ability to detect loud noises not just zombies.\n- Silent Storm levels of terrain destruction.",

I don't dislike the XCOM games so I'm not too mad, but considering who's making it I'm still disappointed about how it's literally just a straight-up copy of XCOM with a different visual theme and some neat new gimmicks tacked on, rather than something that takes the original X-Com games into the modern era. I'll still play the game and probably enjoy it as well, but I can't feel like it's a massive missed opportunity.\n>Hopes/Dreams for XCOM 3\n- Abandon the overly simplified 2-action gameplay model and either bring back time units or something new entirely. \n- Get rid of pods/pod activation and make it so aliens are individually placed on the map and react logically to spotting an enemy. As in, don't just activate a pod whenever you're spotted, activate the one alien that spotted you and give it the ability to call for help or something to bring his friends into the fight. \n- Give stealth/noise a bigger role. So even if you blow up an entire pod (or just a group of enemies if they're no longer using pods), the noise generated will alert everyone nearby and possibly get you overrun. This is similar to what they had with the zombies in WotC except give all aliens the ability to detect loud noises not just zombies.\n- Silent Storm levels of terrain destruction.",

                        "post_msg": "I think WOTC reduces the difficulty too much, it seems extremely hard to lose because of covert ops. Certain resistance orders also trivialize the game. The chosen themselves are neat but talk too much after the first play through. The new maps, also neat but the underground ones are horrible to play on, lost are a huge mistake in general and beyond the first month serve as nothing but infinite XP if you care to suffer the tedium that entails. Basically WOTC feature creeped XCOM2 and they didn't do their math homework from a design standpoint. DONT EVER PUT INFINITE ENEMIES THAT CAN BE FARMED. ESPECIALLY IN A GAME BALANCED AROUND SQUAD SIZE UPGRADES.\nThe added length also makes the campaign too long on legendary, pre WOTC it was about the right length for me, I'd get plasma and be ready to do the last mission, and generally skip 2-3 missions. Chosen weapons are crazy overpowered and not representative of the challenge taking them down is. SPARKs are too good, because they sidestep fatigue. The basic assault rifle upgrades are way too expensive considering you're unlikely to ever have more than one on a mission, or more accuractely mag shotguns are too cheap and come on the same tech. Snipers feel like a waste most of the time... Well I'll stop since I could rant on about the design decisions involved, and don't get me wrong I love XCOM2, but there are some really frustrating decisions in the legendary balancing, especially when they have a designer who is in charge specifically of that difficulty.\nPhoenix Point is looking awesome, willpower seems like such an elegant solution to the problem of XCOM2's untimed missions where cooldown spam removes challenge. Also really looking forward to big squad sizes, easily one of the biggest design issues of XCOM2 is that soldiers are sooo precious, it really hampers the emergent narrative of your games when losing them feels like your campaign might be headed to a loss (pre WOTC anyway).",
